# Queue project
Using different methods to create operations within a Queue 

# Queue and Linked List Implementation

This project contains implementations for a Queue data structure, a recursive linear search, and a Linked List with insertion sort. The queue is implemented using a linked list, and the linear search is modified to find the last occurrence of a target in a vector.

## Features

1. **Queue Implementation**:
   - Push elements into the queue.
   - Pop elements from the queue.
   - Get the front element of the queue.
   - Check if the queue is empty.
   - Move the front element to the rear of the queue.
   - Display all elements in the queue.

2. **Recursive Linear Search**:
   - Find the last occurrence of a target in a vector using recursion.

3. **Linked List with Insertion Sort**:
   - Insert elements into a linked list.
   - Sort the linked list using insertion sort.
   - Display the linked list before and after sorting.
